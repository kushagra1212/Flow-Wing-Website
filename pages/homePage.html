    <h2>About Flow-Wing</h2>
    <p>
      Flow-Wing is a modern programming language that combines the best of both
      worlds: static and dynamic typing. Designed for both novice and
      experienced developers, it emphasizes readability and expressiveness,
      enabling users to sculpt logic with the elegance of flow. Flow-Wing
      supports object-oriented programming and provides robust features such as
      dynamic and static memory allocation, automatic garbage collection, and
      module support. With compile-time checks, Flow-Wing helps catch errors
      early, facilitating a smooth development experience.
